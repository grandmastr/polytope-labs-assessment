This is a reproduction of the background animation from [app.hyperbridge.network](https://app.hyperbridge.network), with extra opmtimizations on top of that. I implemented it in _two ways:_

1.  **Pattern** - This uses inline SVG (direct insertion into the DOM) with `<pattern>`/`<use>` tiling.
2.  **Alternative** - This uses external SVG as a CSS background.
